A VR experiment using the javascript libraries p5.js and A-Frame. This project was built for Interactive Computing at NYU. It was developed with the following p5-A-frame framework built by our professor:

Additionally I used an open source 360 photo provided from here:

The remaining assets were developed with Dalle-2. Feel free to use and adapt this project as needed while including a link to this repo. Enjoy!
